# Introduction
This branch contains material no longer used which instead of throwing away I decided to put it on a different branch.

## <a href="./SHSMTool/">RenderEclipse Extractor (Pre-CMake Setup)</a>
This is the original source code of the RenderEclipse Extractor previous to the switch to CMake. It was develop using Visual Studio 2022, however due the slowness of my PC I decided to move development to Visual Studio Code and using CMake for compiling while still using the MSCV compiler.
